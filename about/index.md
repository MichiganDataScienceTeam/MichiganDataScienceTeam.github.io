The Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) is a club at the University of Michigan which brings together students of various disciplines through competitions structured around finding patterns in data. Sometimes we compete in public competitions online and sometimes we compete in challenges we create for ourselves. We also partner with other organizations to try and help people with their data problems. Sometimes we even make a challenge out of that!
