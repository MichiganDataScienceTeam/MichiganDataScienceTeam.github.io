The Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) is a competitive collegiate data science team at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Together, we compete against professional and amateur data scientists from around the world in online prediction challenges.

Competitive data science has become increasingly prominent in the past decade with the immense popularity of high-profile competitions such as The Netflix Prize. Now, online venues such as Kaggle, DrivenData, and Quantopian, among others, provide platforms for data scientists around the world to make impactful contributions to a huge variety of prediction problems while competing for cash prizes. Previous competitions have explored prediction problems in healthcare, particle physics, finance, and countless other domains, and have involved many types of structured and unstructured data.

We are a new organization at the University of Michigan that is looking for dedicated students who are interested in taking part in data science competitions. Ideally, students will have a strong background in computer science, mathematics, and statistics, but all students are welcome to participate. We will be meeting on a weekly basis throughout the year, where students can share strategies and give tutorials. Anyone is welcome to attend these meetings! For your hard work and dedication, we will be offering internal prizes to the students who achieve the highest performance on our prediction challenges.
