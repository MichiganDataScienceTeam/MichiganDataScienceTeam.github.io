The Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) is a competitive collegiate data science
team at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Together, we compete against
professional and amateur data scientists from around the world in online
prediction challenges.

Competitive data science has become increasingly prominent in the past decade
with the immense popularity of high-profile competitions such as The Netflix
Prize. Now, online venues such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/),
DrivenData, and Quantopian, among others, provide platforms for data scientists
around the world to make impactful contributions to a huge variety of
prediction problems while competing for cash prizes. Previous competitions have
explored prediction problems in healthcare, particle physics, finance, and
countless other domains, and have involved many types of structured and
unstructured data.

We are a new organization at the University of Michigan that is looking for
dedicated students who are interested in taking part in data science
competitions. Ideally, students will have a strong background in computer
science, mathematics, and statistics, but all students are welcome to
participate. We will be meeting on a weekly basis throughout the year, where
students can share strategies and give tutorials. Anyone is welcome to attend
these meetings! For your hard work and dedication, we will be offering internal
prizes to the students who achieve the highest performance on our prediction
challenges.
