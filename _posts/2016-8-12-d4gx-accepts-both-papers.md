Earlier this summer, MDST submitted two papers to the Bloomberg [Data For Good Exchange](www.bloomberg.com/company/d4gx/) conference regarding our work on the Flint Water Crisis and with the University Musical Society respectively. It is my great pleasure to announce that the conference has elected both of our papers for presentation at the conference in New York on September 25th!

Needless to say, we're all very excited. ðŸŽ‰
