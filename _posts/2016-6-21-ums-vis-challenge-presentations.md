The University Musical Society (UMS) Challenge began the last month of school before exams and concluded shortly after exams ended. The challenge was simple: we asked our members to take three years of ticket sale data from UMS and explore--and explore they did! We ended up with three separate teams, each with distinct presentations and deliverables. In honor of the hard work and precious time these teams put into their projects, we are taking a post to point out some of the more novel or interesting findings here.


### A bit about UMS

UMS is a non-profit company based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which aims to bring a variety of musical acts and theatrical performances to venues around town. Everything from The Bad Plus, to 2Chainz, to the __ORCHESTRA GOES HERE__, UMS is in the business of providing culture to the people of Ann Arbor at a reduced price. They offer tickets at the door, as well as online ticket sales--just like most ticket retailers. However, they also offer a subscription service. If you like the symphonic performances you can buy tickets to many of those concerts in the off season for a drastically reduced price.

### Analyzing a Customer Base

Many businesses seek to drive their customers away from single ticket purchases and get them on subscription plans.
