This week, Jared will be talking about hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparamters are like options for your model. The regularization term (lambda) in Ridge Regression, the number of trees and the maximum number of branches in your random forests--these are all known as "Hyperparameters". Many models work well "out of the box", but often times there are better hyperparameters than the defaults set by some random contributor to sk-learn.
