Plotting! This week, we investigate one of the most crucial data science skills: effective communication! Fancy models, features, and relationships are difficult to explain with math alone. In this notebook, we demonstrate useful settings, packages, and plotting techniques for communicating your findings.

This is the first part of a two part tutorial. You can find the second part [here]({{ site.url }}/mdst-tutorial-7).
