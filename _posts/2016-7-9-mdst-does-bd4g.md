While we are known for our participation in structured prediction challenges, MDST has picked up at least two community projects in the last year. MDST members of all experience levels got to participate in both our efforts in Flint and our work with UMS's ticket purchase data. Around the time that we hit milestones in both projects, news of the [Bloomberg Data 4 Good Exchange](http://www.bloomberg.com/company/d4gx/) call for papers reached some members of MDST and we decided to take a shot.

The results of our foray into volunteer, remote, academic paper collaboration can be found below in the form of two successfully written MDST papers! We're incredibly proud of the results and even prouder of our membership, who worked so hard to produce such quality work.
