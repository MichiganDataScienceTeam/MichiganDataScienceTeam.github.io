Our very own Jacob Abernethy was recently interviewed on the popular machine learning podcast, _[Talking Machines](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/)_. Among other things, Jake was asked about his experiences working with the trove of municipal data available in Flint, his path to research at the University of Michigan, and our work with Google and UM-Flint. 

You can find a link to the interview [here](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/2016/7/21/perturb-and-map-and-machine-learning-in-the-flint-water-crisis). Fun Fact: _Talking Machines_ is produced by [Kathrine Goreman](http://www.katherinelgorman.com/), a UM alumna!
